Build
=====

To build the current stack:

- install node and npm
	- download binary package
	
- install handlebars
	sudo npm install handlebars -g

- install python
	- make sure it is on your path

- install ruby
	- make sure it is on your path
	
- install compass
	sudo gem install compass

- ./build.sh

That will create a new folder called webapp-build, and you can load app.html in a web-browser.
